## Problem 

This course takes a coding-focused approach towards learning. In each notebook, we'll focus on solving one problem, and learn the techniques, algorithms, and data structures to devise an *efficient* solution. We will then generalize the technique and apply it to other problems.



In this notebook, we focus on solving the following problem:

> **QUESTION 1:** Alice has some cards with numbers written on them. She arranges the cards in decreasing order, and lays them out face down in a sequence on a table. She challenges Bob to pick out the card containing a given number by turning over as few cards as possible. Write a function to help Bob locate the card.

This may seem like a simple problem, especially if you're familiar with the concept of _binary search_, but the strategy and technique we learning here will be widely applicable, and we'll soon use it to solve harder problems.
